# P-G-2021-2023-financial-analysis
In this project, we conducted a comprehensive financial analysis of P&G by calculating key financial ratios from their income statement and balance sheet. We visualized these metrics through various charts to better understand trends, profitability, liquidity, and efficiency. The analysis highlighted P&G's steady revenue growth, stable profit margins, and balanced financial structure, while also identifying areas for improvement, such as liquidity and interest coverage. This approach provided valuable insights into P&Gâ€™s financial health and performance over the analyzed periods.
